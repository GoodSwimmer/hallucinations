We further acknowledge that we, as an organization, have benefited from the use and occupation of this stolen land. Given the ongoing, damaging injustices of colonization, Southern Exposure is committed to supporting our Bay Area community of diverse artists and Indigenous-led partnerships that extend Indigenous self-determination in San Francisco. We aspire to be good stewards of arts, culture, and generative conversations while always mindful of greater equity and justice.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c9">This living statement represents an ongoing dialogue with the </span><span class="c4 c12 c17">Association of Ramaytush Ohlone</span><span class="c4 c9">.</span><span class="c20 c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c17">Many thanks to the </span><span class="c4 c12 c17">Association of Ramaytush Ohlone, Gregg Castro,</span><span class="c11 c4 c9">&nbsp;and Jonathan Cordero.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Donations to the </span><span class="c4 c12">Association of Ramaytush Ohlone</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are strongly encouraged and can be made at </span><span class="c4 c10"><a class="c21" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ramaytush.org/donate&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1653684425997554&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tJ86Gdjmp7FVodRHUA92B">ramaytush.org/donate</a></span><span class="c4">.&nbsp;</span><span class="c20">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c4 c9 c11"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c9 c18">This exhibition is generously supported by grants from the Creative Work Fund, California Humanities, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as Southern Exposure&rsquo;s members and donors.</span></p>

<p>  Southern Exposure (SoEx) is an artist-centered non-profit organization committed to supporting visual artists. Through our extensive and innovative programming, SoEx strives to experiment, collaborate and further educate while providing an extraordinary resource center and forum for Bay Area and national artists and youth in our Mission District space and off-site, in the public realm.

<p>
  An active presence in the Bay Area since 1974, SoEx is continually evolving in response to the needs of artists and the community while engaging the public in artists' work. Central to our mission is to remain the most accessible space for visual artists to produce and present new work, learn, and connect. SoEx provides visual artists with the tools and resources they need to experiment in an open and supportive environment. We also work to advocate to new, diverse audiences and build an ever-growing community of enthusiasts and supporters of the visual arts.
