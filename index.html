            <h1>Echoes of Land and Soundings of Place</h1>
<h2>by Josh Rios</h2>
<br />

<p>

It feels appropriate to start with an acknowledgment. In the spirit of Cristóbal Martínez’s sonic and sculptural installation, <i>Hallucinations of Remembrance and Imminence</i>, this cannot be an acknowledgement in the service of facile resolution or the relieving of settler guilt. It cannot be a land acknowledgment as commonly understood within the discourse of the occupier’s institution. Rather, it must involve a poetics of place and emplacement—a rhythmic and atonal composition enlivened by performance, sustained across space and time, and dedicated to the human, greater-than-human, biologic, and non-biologic alike. On the one hand, I’m writing this from the traditional homelands and waterways of the Potawatomi, which have been and remain an active and complex social site since time immemorial. But I’m also writing this from all the homelands my ancestors arrived from, resided upon, and moved through, including the borderlands where I grew up in both rural and urban contexts, where my family has lived since before there was such a thing as a U.S.-Mexico divide. Southern Exposure, where <i>Hallucinations of Remembrance and Imminence</i> was exhibited, is also situated on Indigenous land, namely the homelands of the original peoples of the San Francisco Peninsula, the Ramaytush Ohlone. Acknowledgment of place must confront history, as well as all the ways that land and far-flung peoples are brought into the grain and patterns of our contemporary lives.
</p>
<p>
Questions remain. Across whose homelands and in relation to whose dispossession has the oil been transported that makes possible the utility-scale production of electricity required to power our daily existences and cultural experiences, including the computer servers that make this writing possible? Maybe in the end writing alone is incapable of sustaining the type of heterotemporal reflection on roots, terrain, movement, growth, and decay required of acknowledgment. To paraphrase Stuart Hall, whenever I ask someone where they are from, I expect a long story. What happens if we ask the land where it is from? While the land may appear to simply exist—to not be from anywhere—it nevertheless has a past. This past is not, however, synonymous with History in the Western tradition, as a genre of writing or disciplinary way of describing the rise and fall of so-called civilizations. But if the land has a story and not a History, how does it communicate and what kind of translation does it require? Laura Perez’s notion of the hallucination as a form of decolonial reoccupation of a mythic, albeit contested, homeland is relevant: “to reoccupy Aztlán, the oppressed hallucinate—and that practice has no borders.”<sup>1</sup> Site, emplacement, positionality, storytelling, embodiment, the fantastical, and the uncanny are central sonic and material themes in <i>Hallucinations of Remembrance and Imminence</i>.</p>
<p>
  I first spoke to Cristóbal, alongside their collaborator in Red Culebra, Guillermo Galindo, for the New Latin Wave Arts Festival in 2021. Our trialogue, prompted by Mateo and Malinda Galindo of Atomic Culture, took place remotely and meandered in exciting ways across various sonic topics. We reflected on our respective sound practices, methodological approaches, and various philosophies of music, sound, memory, and politics. I want to start this engagement anew by quoting Cristóbal at length from that conversation:
</p>

<p class="quote">
  There is a narrative disconnection between the notion of sound and material because sound is often associated with the ephemeral. This ephemerality is sometimes incongruent with what we think of as material. We tend to think of some materials as more archival than others. . . .  If something is cast in bronze, for example, we associate that with a discourse of “forever.” But nothing lasts forever. There are different durations of time associated with material. If we start to think in terms of duration—how long does something last—if we start to ask that question, then we can start to think of sound as a kind of material. It is a material in the present moment that is proximately emerging.<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>

As a sonic installation, <i>Hallucinations of Remembrance and Imminence</i> may appear relatively emptied of materiality, especially if we offhandedly accept the narrative disconnection Cristóbal warns against—to think of sound as dematerialized because it appears ephemeral. The quote asks us to consider how human-scale understandings of time inform our ideas about materiality. Bronze appears to last a long time and thus seems particularly material in its orientation, at least within a human-scale understanding and experience of temporality. But everything loses matter eventually. Atoms break off and enter their entropic incarnations. Galaxies collide. Energy dissipates. Time itself, as the empty unit of a measuring apparatus like a clock, is far from an objective fact. As a homogenous individuated string of segments, time is a recent, if ubiquitous, human development.</p>
<p>
Two studio monitors, which articulate a greater range of frequencies than most consumer-grade speakers, greet the audience as they approach Cristóbal’s installation. Already, we see and hear the apparatus, the material support that shapes not only what but how audio information is delivered, putting aside the mechanics of the human ear. Mounted on stands, the studio monitors play a six-minute-long looped composition titled <i>Goathead</i>. The goat head referred to is the burr of a low-to-the-ground plant, typically considered a weed, that grows in arid, well-draining, and elevated areas. It is worth noting that the burr is also a seed. A technology of dissemination, it attaches itself to the fur of traveling animals, moving across the terrain at the speed of another. <i>Goathead</i>, composed of samples and synth sounds, has an otherworldly quality that is also of this world. It makes the worldly otherworldly and vice versa. It makes the strange familiar and the familiar strange. Most of the composition is reminiscent of wind blowing over a microphone mixed with arrhythmical rattlings like small wooden chimes clanking together far off in the synthetic breeze. Intermittently, a shell horn sounds out in the distance. At times the composition sounds like it is underwater, a nod to a geologic temporality measured less by calendars or clocks and more by slow shifts in the landscape, including the ever-changing profiles of oceans and rivers.
</p>

<p>
Vinyl text on a nearby wall reads, “Between mountains, I grew / up on a dry plateau / with a river. / Watching, determined, / eroding and surrounding, / the desert tried to tell me / about the future. / I still feel it in my hearing.”<sup>3</sup> The line breaks of the first sentence create an ambiguous space of relationality. The narrator describes the plateau as having a river, which makes expected sense. But the narrator can also be understood as saying, I grew up with a river, as opposed to growing up nearby or beside a river. The narrator and the river grew up together, with each other, in kinship. The human and greater-than-human are brought into relation. Through imaginative practices linked in both material and symbolic ways, the distant is brought into proximity, or imminence, to use Cristóbal’s word. The introductory wall poetics also introduce the idea of the desert as a storyteller, even a seer or visionary, since the story told is of the future. Numerous temporalities mingle in the short text, with the present tense evoked in the last line break: “I still feel it in my hearing.” The mixed metaphor of feeling something, not in the typical literary location of the heart, but in the process of hearing, is a significant shift announcing the limitations of making meaning from a message through the usual methods. Hallucination is required. Cristóbal’s narrator asks us to note the ways knowledge is a material process of being in relation to the land and to the ephemerality of experience, as opposed to knowledge as a rational conclusion one settles upon. Even as human-scale experience is displaced by the abstraction of an uncanny algorithmic sonic composition, the reflection of an unseen landscape is deeply heard and imminently felt.
</p>
<p>
Behind the entryway speakers and the wall text is a black curtain leading to the rest of the installation, a room evocative of an exhibition screening space. The walls are black. Four speakers are situated in the corners. Dampening panels hang on the walls like post-minimalist paintings. Their job is not so much to impart cryptic information as to help shape the four-channel 45-minute audio composition filling the room, <i>Shingled Brain, Heroin Spine, Irradiated Tongue, Callous</i>. The audio work consists largely of a meandering low drone, a cross between the synthetic sound of howling wind, throat singing, and a thunderstorm rumbling in the distance. It is carefully punctuated at spacious intervals by short runs of chirping synths that give way to buzzing and bird songs over the course of the composition. In the middle of the space a cylindrical metal tank hangs on a thick silver chain from the ceiling like a punching bag. The bottom has been sawed off, transforming the closed form of the tank into the open end of a bell, its gaseous contents released long ago. A laborer’s rubber mallet is staged on a pedestal encouraging guests to strike the tank/bell, tolling an iron note for a landscape. Sound has an ability to connect us, to make us part of a communal experience of listening, to bring us together into a body politic or listening entity. Yet, even without being struck, one imagines the tone of the suspended tank as metallic and resonant. One imagines the communal experience of listening to the memorial ringing. Within a colonial framework, the bell has a particular history. Especially associated with churches in the Southwest, the bell was a colonial tool of social control used to structure Indigenous life. The ringing bell let the subjugated know when to wake, eat, labor, rest, and mourn. The material list of the audio composition <i>Shingled Brain, Heroin Spine, Irradiated Tongue, Callous</i> includes the metal tank/bell. It is a sculpture, a compositional element, and a performative prop. Its unscripted and spontaneous striking suggests there is no correct or incorrect timing, that any time is the right time for anyone to add to the ongoing composition. The temporal regime of the bell as marking the capitalist clock hour is disrupted by the openness of the participatory invitation. To strike the bell, not at a given interval, but when the need or opportunity arises, acknowledges a kind of ontology without subjectivity—to be without being overdetermined by social, colonial, and capitalist power. While the generativity of the sound synthesis is open to the generativity of the human participant, it is also indifferent to it. After all, the temporality of the geologic and the temporality of the human are so vastly different that the difference is not of degree but of kind. A golden-brown light saturates the space in the color of an irradiated desert at dusk or a Martian landscape. The repurposed silver tank haunts the center of the room, conjuring the image of both a spacecraft frozen in time and a manufacturing storage site. The transfiguration of the materiality of an industrial metal tank and the symbol of the bell, like the exhibition, gives unexpected life to routine forms and invites meditation on metaphor, memory, place, and temporality.
</p>
<p>
By and large, the sound works that comprise the installation operate as speculative field recordings, or at least as field recording adjacent, since they are made of samples and synthesized sounds. Is <i>Goathead</i> or <i>Shingled Brain, Heroin Spine, Irradiated Tongue, Callous</i> the sound of the desert telling its tale of the future? Perhaps so, but only in a way that refuses predictable notions of authentic sonic veracity, rightly preferring the power of the rigorous hypothetical to tell a truth that cannot be or was not documented. Paul Hegarty refers to the catch and capture of sonic field recordings as a rational attempt to represent “something that ‘just is,’” so that the “‘whatness’ of the sounds is valorized over the ‘whatness’ of the recording.”<sup>4</sup> Hegarty goes on to describe the anthropological roots of audio field recordings as serving a similar function as field notes, to extract and fragment ethnographic information that will eventually be recontextualized, reassembled, and reinterpreted by a sanctioned disciplinary professional creating specific forms of scriptocentric knowledge. In the case of nature, which tends to be incorrectly bifurcated from culture, Hegarty describes environmental audio recordings as similarly “transaudient,” meaning portrayed as “simply available for hearing, signifying the real or adding realness to the core, structured work.”<sup>5</sup> To record the sound of nature is not to make it transparently available, but to apprehend “the sounds of the world in a process of ‘phonography’ (the sounds of the world, ‘caught’ in mediated, documented, aural form).”<sup>6</sup> The overall effect of Hegarty’s work is to challenge the facile understanding of a sonic field recording as a fact, and instead think of the field recording as a mediated event captured through the technology of a motivated and interested party, often rooted in anthropological, ethnographic, and colonial notions of rational objectivity. Just as there is no such thing as an unmediated sound, there is no such thing as a universal listener. Every listener inhabits a social, historical, and political position that necessarily informs their attunement.
</p>
And while <i>Goathead</i> and <i>Shingled Brain, Heroin Spine, Irradiated Tongue, Callous</i> may be imagined, as I am doing here cautiously, as a kind of speculative field recording, they do not valorize rational objectivity. Rather, they signal the hallucinatory power of the imagination to conjure the compositional and experimental voice of the landscape over the ability to capture or represent it through so-called documentation. Taken as a whole installation that features exhibition programming with Cristóbal’s collaborative projects Radio Healer (Martinez with Devin Armstrong-Best, Edgar Cardenas, Ashya Flint, Randy Kemp, Raven Kemp, Rykelle Kemp, Mere Martinez, and Melissa S. Rex), Red Culebra (Martinez with Guillermo Gallindo), and the collective Deer Woman (Julia Fairbrother and Raven Kemp), <i>Hallucinations of Remembrance and Imminence</i> functions as a network of intelligence and relationality focused on place, narrative, and technologic alchemy. In a virtual discussion following a screening of Radio Healer’s video work, Wandering in the Woods, collective member Edgar Cardenas notes there is a correlation between the health of an ecosystem and the diversity of the frequencies it emits. As such, the gap in a place’s sonic bandwidth tells an auditory story of the changing biosphere. Designed to create openings for dialog, <i>Hallucinations of Remembrance and Imminence</i> tunes digital and sampled soundscapes, as well as sculpture, installation, and discursive programming to metaphorically replace frequencies lost to climate change and environmental degradation, as well as to (re)present the uncanny characteristics of the lands and places we come from, occupy, and commune with, but also that exceed us and our sensorial frames.

      <h1>Hallucinations of Remembrance and Imminence</h1>
      <h2>February 2 - March 19, 2022
      Solo Exhibition by Cristóbal Martínez</h2>
      <br />

<p>
  <i>Hallucinations of Remembrance and Imminence</i> was a solo project by Cristóbal Martinez commissioned by Southern Exposure in San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
  Cristóbal Martínez”s electro-acoustic sound environments of Hallucinations of Remembrance and Imminence evoke sonic impressions of the artist’s childhood growing up in the expanse and presence of his ancestral landscape – the high desert of North Central New Mexico. Visitors were encouraged to strike the suspended sculptural bell in grief for the land and ecosystem in extreme drought and in acknowledgment of animal populations currently disappearing as their habitats are increasingly destroyed by human behavior.
</p>

<p>
  Cristóbal Martínez is an artist in Postcommodity and Associate Professor and Chair of Art and Technology at the San Francisco Art Institute. He is Mestizo, of the Genizaro, Pueblo, Manito, and Chicano people of Northern New Mexico. Using ritual, Martínez aspires to make poetic an idea-driven, propositional and self-implicating art that imagines sites of contest, controversy, conflict, and consequence into places of public pedagogy, curiosity, and conversation.
</p>

<p>
  Martínez in Postcommodity has exhibited work in prominent national and international museums, exhibitions, and festivals including the 18th Biennale of Sydney, Adelaide International, Contour the 5th Biennale of the Moving Image, Nuit Blanche, Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, 2017 Whitney Biennial, Art in General, documenta14, the 57th Carnegie International, Art Institute of Chicago, San Francisco Art Institute, LAXART, Minneapolis Art Institute, Remai Modern Museum, and the historic land art installation Repellent Fence at the U.S./Mexico border Near Douglas, AZ and Agua Prieta, SON.

As an organization that has been based in the Mission district of San Francisco since 1974, we honor and recognize the Native people who have stewarded this land for thousands upon thousands of years and who continue to do so. We further acknowledge that we, as an organization, have benefited from the use and occupation of this stolen land. Given the ongoing, damaging injustices of colonization, Southern Exposure is committed to supporting our Bay Area community of diverse artists and Indigenous-led partnerships that extend Indigenous self-determination in San Francisco. We aspire to be good stewards of arts, culture, and generative conversations while always mindful of greater equity and justice.
